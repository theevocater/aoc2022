# Advent of Code 2022
In which I take another swing at advent of code. lets see if i can get to day
15 this year in rust.

if you want to borrow my main file a few tips:
1. Create a file called TOKEN w/ the session token. grab it out of chrome's
   cookie jar
1. `cargo run --bin aoc2022 1` to generate day 1, then `cargo run --bin day1p1
   < input_day1.txt` to run day 1 part 1 with the input you just downloaded
